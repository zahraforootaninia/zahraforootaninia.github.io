### About Me

I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota. My research focus is on guiding and control simulations of highly dynamic phenomena for computer graphics and robotics applications. Currently, I am doing my research under the supervision of Dr. Rahul Narain and co-advised by Dr. Stephen Guy . previously, I got my M.Sc. in Astrophysics from the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Minnesota in February 2015. My current research lies on simulating a highly dynamic phenomena, such as smoke and crowd, with control over the behavior of the system while the behavior stays natural and realistic.

# Header 1

This is a normal paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

## Header 2

> This is a blockquote following a header.

> When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.

### Header 3

```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l)
  return true;
}
```

```ruby
# Ruby code with syntax highlighting
GitHubPages::Dependencies.gems.each do |gem, version|

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
