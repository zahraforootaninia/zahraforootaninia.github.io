## Quaternions: Walking Skeleton

I applied quaternion implementation in order to move and rotate the bones of walking Skeleton.
Quaternions became so popular in many areas in computer animation. Quaternions can describe objects orientation in a very simple mathematical notation in three dimensions. They can make stable and smooth results. In addition we can avoid the gimbal lock can happen during the rotation using Euler angles.
