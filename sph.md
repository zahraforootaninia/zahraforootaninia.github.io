## SPH : Accretion Disk

I applied the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) solver with magnetic field added to the background to 10,000 particles which are orbiting a massive object with 10 times mass of the sun.
Since particles in the fluid has electric charge, they feel the magnetic force,and start to move in perpendicular direction to the magnetic field (based on Right-hand rule). Therefore, we expect to see the fluid flows in a specific direction which produce a jet.
